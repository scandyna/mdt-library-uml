format 211

note 128002 "Idea:
When importing data from a text file (f.ex. CSV), all columns represent Strings.
It is sometimes needed to have defined (expected) format for specific columns:
| Id (int) | Name (String) |
----------------------------------
|      12   | Name 12         |

It could be good to create a proxy model that handles that."
